Deeper Blue was an assistive chess robot enabling disabled players to compete in tournaments. It helps to pick up the chess pieces to the given location through web-app. In a group of 9, I helped design the body of the robot using LEGO, built the connection between the robot and computer and worked on the web-app. Technologies used: EV3, python, JavaScript, TCP socket.
