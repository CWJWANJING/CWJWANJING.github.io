Mukulele is a gamified ukulele learning app that aims to motivate users to keep learning ukulele. The main feature, gamified song challenge, was achieved by embedding the developed Unity visualisation into the Android app. Two runs of user evaluation were conducted to increase the usability of the app. The demonstration of the app can be found [here]("https://youtu.be/APM2M3K48fY").
Technologies used: Android Studio, Unity, C#
